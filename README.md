# Python_Examples

Here are the examples for the python portion of the 2019 CHPC/NITHEP summerschool.
A few extra, potentially useful examples are included as well.
If any of the participants would like to share the code from their projects that they presented, they can
generate a pull-request, or email them to me (please add a comment at the beginning of the code, saying who's work it was, etc).
