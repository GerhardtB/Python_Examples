# a first program to print hello and do some maths
#create a variable called name, containing your name
name = 'andrew'
#print hello to the person in name
print("Hello "+name)
#calculate 432*2.3 and save it in a variable called x
x = 432*2.3
# or you can do this:
# a = 432
# b = 2.3
# x = a*b
#print the value of x
print("The value of x is "+str(x))
