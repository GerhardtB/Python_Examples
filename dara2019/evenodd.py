#Exercise: Write a program that determines whether a variable is even or odd

# define a variable x
x = 10
# check whether there is a non-zero remainder
if x%2 == 0:
	print(str(x)+" is even")
else:
	print(str(x)+" is odd")
print("done!")
# if there is, print a message that the number is odd
# otherwise, print a message that it is even
