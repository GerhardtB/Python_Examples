# a short program to show how to import the math library and use a for-loop with range
# load the math library
import math

# a for-loop starting at 0 (default) and running to 99 (<100)
for i in range(100):
    #for each value in the range, calculate and print out the square-root of the value
    print(math.sqrt(i))
